Explanation:
 * Initialization:
   * Import necessary modules (pygame, random).
   * Initialize Pygame and create the game window.
   * Define colors.
   * Load car images.
   * Set initial positions for the player and opponent cars.
 * Game Loop:
   * The while running loop continues until the game is exited.
   * Handle player input (left and right arrow keys).
   * Move the opponent car downwards.
   * Check for collision between the player and opponent cars.
   * Reset the opponent car's position if it goes off the screen.
   * Draw the background and cars on the screen.
   * Update the display.
 * Quitting the Game:
   * When the game is over or the player quits, the pygame.quit() function is called to exit Pygame.
To run this code:
 * Save: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., racing_game.py).
 * Install Pygame: If you haven't already, install Pygame using pip install pygame.
 * Run: Execute the script from your terminal using python racing_game.py.
To improve this code:
 * Add more cars: Create multiple opponent cars with varying speeds.
 * Implement scoring: Track the player's score based on how long they survive.
 * Create a track: Draw a road or track on the screen.
 * Add obstacles: Introduce obstacles like trees or barriers.
 * Improve graphics: Use better-looking car images and background graphics.
 * Sound effects: Add sound effects for collisions, scoring, and other game events.
This basic example provides a foundation for building a more complex and engaging racing game. You can experiment with different game mechanics, graphics, and sound effects to create your own unique racing experience.
